# Contribution

Contribution to lightX DB is actually quite easy, you will find that most code is documented and the wiki will explain most of it, nevertheless, the code itself is quite self-explanatory. 

### Issues and advancements

Issues and some advancements will be present in the issues section. In order to contribute, you could create a fork, upload your own files and start a pull request. We will review the change and if passed, you will find your change in the next release.

### Building your code

The code can be built by first cloning the repository, and then using the lightX Compiler to compile all the .py files. **Important: Do not include any other files or folders, as in shown in the options. Instead, just compile the main file (lX.py) and put all the other files with it in uncompiled form.**  That will be sufficient for the builds. To create a installer for it, use Actual Installer and follow its instructions to package and create a installer.

These instructions may likely be changed in the future.  

Thank you for helping lX to become better!
